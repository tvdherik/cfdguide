Download the Guide [here]()

### The Guide
This guide was produced to provide a CFD walkthrough for PhD, MPhil, etc. students completing experimental hyperonics research in the University of Queenslands, XLabs super-orbital expansion tube laboratory. The guide offers a revision of key theory as well as tutorials to produce Hyperonsic CFD from the ground up in Eilmer4.

### Eilmer4
Eilmer4 is one of multiple programs which can be found in the gas dynamics tool kit [gdtk](https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/) maintained by the University of Queensland. Please note, Eilmer4 has additional guides and further examples of Eilmer4 use and verification on their website.
