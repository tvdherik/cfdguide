### The Guide
This guide was produced to provide a CFD walkthrough for beginner PhD, MPhil, etc. students completing experimental hyperonics research in the University of Queenslands, XLabs super-orbital expansion tube laboratory. The guide offers a revision of key theory as well as tutorials to produce Hyperonsic CFD from the ground up in Eilmer4.

#### Topics currently in the Guide

* Gas models
* High-temperature gas effects
* Chemistry models
* Energy transfer
* Installation and setup of Ubuntu and Eilmer4
* Paraview setup
* Examples of constructing fundamental hypersonic geometry in Eilmer4
  * Wedges
  * Cones
  * Double hypersonic wings
  * Cylinders
  * Data-point based geometreis (ex: Stardust capsule)
  * Parametric models (ex: Hayabusa 2 capsule)
* Simulating high-temperature gas effects in Eilmer4
  * Finite-rate chemistry
  * Two-temperature models for thermochemical non-equilibrium

### Eilmer4
Eilmer4 (a compressible flow CFD tool) is one of multiple programs which can be found in the gas dynamics tool kit ([gdtk](https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/)) maintained by the University of Queensland. Please note, Eilmer4 has additional guides and further examples and verification on their website.
