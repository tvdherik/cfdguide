### Author
T. J. Herik - XLabs Research Assistant, Mechanical Engineer, Aerospace Engineer, Mathematician.

### The Guide
This guide was produced to provide a CFD walkthrough for beginner PhD, MPhil, etc. students completing experimental hyperonics research in the University of Queenslands, XLabs super-orbital expansion tube laboratory. The guide offers a revision of key theory as well as tutorials to produce Hyperonsic CFD from the ground up in Eilmer4.

### Eilmer4
Eilmer4 (a compressible flow CFD tool) is one of multiple programs which can be found in the gas dynamics tool kit ([gdtk](https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/)) maintained by the University of Queensland. Please note, Eilmer4 has additional guides and further examples and verification on their website.
