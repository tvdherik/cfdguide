Download the Guide [here](cfdguide.pdf)

### The Guide
This guide was produced to provide a CFD walkthrough for beginner PhD, MPhil, etc. students completing experimental hyperonics research in the University of Queenslands, XLabs super-orbital expansion tube laboratory. The guide offers a revision of key theory as well as tutorials to produce Hyperonsic CFD from the ground up in Eilmer4.

The guide currently standands at 50 pages and includes the following:
